# GDPR-Extensions-com - Social Feed Curator 2xClick Solution

GDPR-Extensions-com - Social Feed Curator 2xClick Solution allows you to add your curated social feed through curator.io to your website while staying GDPR compliant! This solution will allow your website viewers to manage their cookies consent and decide whether or not to view the content.

Your curated social feed will not be detected on any cookie scanner as a GDPR threat. Instead, it will show as a manageable cookie if used with the GDPR Consent Manager.

## Features

### Without GDPR-extensions.com Consent Manager:
- The curator.io cookie will not be created until the user has consented to view the content.
- Once the user has consented, the content mask will be removed, and the user will be able to view the social feed from curator.io. The cookie is created when the user has consented, with a default session duration of 30 days.
- Users will not be able to update their cookie preferences, and their data will be saved until the session expires.

### With GDPR-extensions.com Consent Manager:
- The GDPR-Extensions-com Consent Manager extension is powered by the gdpr-extensions.com dashboard.
- Scans your website and auto-detects cookies and external sources.
- Provides a content element “Consent Manager” that lists all cookies and allows users to manage the Social Feed Curator 2xClick cookie anytime.
- Website viewers can view the Consent Manager anytime by clicking on the cookie widget, which can be customized in styling, language, content, and position.
